# GettingCleaningDataProj
The project submission for the Getting and Cleaning Data course. 

This repo contains
* This README file which describes each file and its contents
* a script file run_analysis.R, which will clean the variable names, and clip together the test and train data
* a code book CodeBook.md, which describes the origin of the data, the cleaning of the data that I performed, and gives a definition for each variable.
